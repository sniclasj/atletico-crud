# Atletico Crud

![Am I Responsive](documentation/testing/atletico-crud-am-i-responsive.png)

Atletico Crud is an online soccer/football database.

The database contains players who are renowned as having 'legend status' for a particular club, in a particular league within a particular country _e.g. Alan Shearer who played for Newcastle United in the Premier League in England._

The aim of the website is for users to view players who have already been inducted to the database and for them to submit their own suggestions for players to be entered into the database via a Form.

The website's admin will then review the submitted forms and decide whether to create a new entry. The admin has the ability to create/add, read/view, update/edit and delete data.

# UX

The aim of the site is to be as minimal as possible so that attention is focused on the database content.

Once registered or logged in, users are taken their profile page. From here, the ever present navigation bar allows the user to navigate to Countries, Leagues, Clubs or Players. When utilising the links in the navbar directly _e.g. clicking Clubs_, the user will be directed to a view showing all clubs across all leagues present in the database. However, if the player were to navigate to _Leagues_ first before selecting _Premier League_, the club's visible would be filitered so that only Premier League clubs are displayed. This gives the user the felxibility to look at what they are most interested in viewing.

Users can also navigate to a _Form_ page to submit their suggestions for players who they believe should be inducted into the database.

The website utilises Materialize CSS to responsively react to different screen sizes so that the user can view content on multiple devices.

## Colour Scheme

I selected the dark-cyan and white colour scheme as they contrasted nicely with each other _e.g. white text on a dark-cyan background or vice versa_. The dark-cyan also didn't clash with any country flag, league logo or club crest/kit and was a more interesting colour than a dark grey or black.

The colour scheme below was generated by [coolors](https://coolors.co/).

![Coolors Colour Scheme](documentation/testing/atletico-crud-coolors.png)

## Typography

The font used for the logo and the page headings is Monoton from Google Fonts. I chose this font as it reminded me of the font utilised by the football/soccer magazine 'Mundial'.

### Navbar

The navbar is always present at the top of the page for large screens and as a collapsible side navbar on smaller screen devices. The links visible depend on the user session status. For example, if no user is logged in, the only links available are Home, Log In and Register. Similarly, the Form link is only visible when logged in as a non-admin user and is hidden when logged in as an admin. This variation in navbar display is achieved via the code snippet below.

![Navbar Large](documentation/testing/atletico-crud-chrome-navbar.png)

![Navbar Mobile](documentation/testing/atletico-crud-safari-sidenav.jpg)

```html
                <ul class="left hide-on-med-and-down">
                    {% if session.user %}
                        <li><a href="{{ url_for('profile', username=session['user']) }}">Profile</a></li>
                        <li><a href="{{ url_for('countries') }}">Countries</a></li>
                        <li><a href="{{ url_for('leagues', country_id=0) }}">Leagues</a></li>
                        <li><a href="{{ url_for('clubs', league_id=0) }}">Clubs</a></li>
                        <li><a href="{{ url_for('playersa', club_id=0) }}">Players</a></li>
                        {% if session.user != "admin"|lower %}
                        <li><a href="{{ url_for('form') }}">Form</a></li>
                        {% endif %}
                        <li><a href="{{ url_for('logout') }}">Log Out</a></li>
                    {% else %}
                        <li><a href="{{ url_for('home') }}">Home</a></li>
                        <li><a href="{{ url_for('login') }}">Log In</a></li>
                        <li><a href="{{ url_for('register') }}">Register</a></li>
                    {% endif %}
                </ul>
```

### Logo

The logo is always visible at the top of the page for large and small screen devices. The logo will link to the profile page if a user is logged in and will link to the home page if no user is logged in. The code snippet below demonstrates how this is achieved.

![Logo](documentation/testing/atletico-crud-logo.png)

```html
{% if session.user %}
                    <a href="{{ url_for('profile', username=session['user']) }}" class="brand-logo right main-title">
                        Atletico Crud
                    </a>
                {% else %}
                    <a href="{{ url_for('home') }}" class="brand-logo right main-title">Atletico Crud</a>
                {% endif %}
```

### Home Page

The home page allows users visiting the website to Register or to Log-In via clickable buttons.
![Home Page](documentation/testing/atletico-crud-chrome-home.png)

### Registration

The registration page allows users to create a username and password to gain access to the site. It will not allow for duplicate usernames which is achieved via the code block below.
There is also a link at the bottom of the registration page to take an user to the log-in page in the event that they have already created an account.

![Registration Page](documentation/testing/atletico-crud-chrome-register.png)

```python
@app.route("/register", methods=["GET", "POST"])
def register():
    if request.method == "POST":
        # check if username already exists in db
        existing_user = Users.query.filter(
            Users.user_name == request.form.get("username").lower()).all()

        if existing_user:
            flash("Username already exists")
            return redirect(url_for("register"))

        user = Users(
            user_name=request.form.get("username").lower(),
            password=generate_password_hash(request.form.get("password"))
            )

        db.session.add(user)
        db.session.commit()

        # put the new user into 'session' cookie
        session["user"] = request.form.get("username").lower()
        flash("Registration Successful!")
        return redirect(url_for("profile", username=session["user"]))

    return render_template("register.html")
```

### Log In

The log-in page allows users to log in using their username and password to gain access to the site. It will alert the user if their credentials are incorrect via the code block below.
There is also a link at the bottom of the log-in page to take an user to the registration page in the event that they need to create an account.

![Log In Page](documentation/testing/atletico-crud-chrome-log-in.png)

```python
@app.route("/login", methods=["GET", "POST"])
def login():
    if request.method == "POST":
        # check if username exists in db
        existing_user = Users.query.filter(
            Users.user_name == request.form.get("username").lower()).all()

        if existing_user:
            print(request.form.get("username"))
            # ensure hashed password matches user input
            if check_password_hash(
                existing_user[0].password, request.form.get("password")):
                    session["user"] = request.form.get("username").lower()
                    flash("Welcome, {}".format(
                        request.form.get("username")))
                    return redirect(url_for(
                        "profile", username=session["user"]))
            else:
                # invalid password match
                flash("Incorrect Username and/or Password")
                return redirect(url_for("login"))

        else:
            # username doesn't exist
            flash("Incorrect Username and/or Password")
            return redirect(url_for("login"))

    return render_template("login.html")
```

### Profile Page

The profile page is what users are directed to once logged-in or registered.

![Profile Page](documentation/testing/atletico-crud-chrome-profile.png)

```python
@app.route("/profile/<username>", methods=["GET", "POST"])
def profile(username):

    if "user" in session:
        return render_template("profile.html", username=session["user"])

    return redirect(url_for("login"))
```

### Log Out

The log-out page allows users to log-out of their profile. This is achieved via the code block below.

![Log Out](documentation/testing/atletico-crud-chrome-log-out.png)

```python
@app.route("/logout")
def logout():
    # remove user from session cookie
    flash("Log Out Successful!")
    session.pop("user")
    return redirect(url_for("login"))
```

### Flash Messages

Flash messages pop up on the page when users complete actions such as logging in, logging out and entry of incorrect credentials. Additionally, when the user is an admin, the flash messages confirm actions such as successfully adding, editing or deleting data.
These flash messages can be seen in the code snippets above and the format of these messages is set in the file base.html which extends to other pages via template inheritance as shown in the code snippet below.

![Flash Messages](documentation/testing/atletico-crud-chrome-flash.png)

```html
    <section>
        <!-- flash messages -->
        {% with messages = get_flashed_messages() %}
        {% if messages %}
        {% for message in messages %}
        <div class="row flashes">
            <h4 class="cyan-text text-darken-4 center-align">{{ message }}</h4>
        </div>
        {% endfor %}
        {% endif %}
        {% endwith %}
    </section>
```

### Countries Page

The countries page displays flags for the countries currently available in the database. When logged in as an admin, the 'Edit' and 'Delete' buttons are visible however these are hidden when logged in as a non-admin user. Clicking on the Country name below the flag image will take the user to the leagues associated with this particular country in the database _e.g. Clicking England will display the English league called Premier League_.

![Countries Page](documentation/testing/atletico-crud-chrome-countries.png)

```html
<div class="row">
    {% for country in countries %}
    <div class="col s12 m6 l3 card-style">
        <div class="card">
            <div class="card-image">
                <img src="{{ country.country_image_url }}" alt="{{ country.country_name }} Flag">
            </div>
            <div class="card-action">
                <a class="card-text-style" href="{{ url_for('leagues', country_id=country.id ) }}">{{ country.country_name }}</a><br>
                {% if session.user|lower == "admin"|lower %}
                <a href="{{ url_for('edit_country', country_id=country.id) }}" class="btn-small green">Edit</a>
                <a href="#modal-{{ country.id }}" class="btn-small red modal-trigger">Delete</a>
                {% endif %}

                <!-- Modal to confirm delete -->
                <div id="modal-{{ country.id }}" class="modal">
                    <div class="modal-content">
                        <h4>Are You Sure?</h4>
                        <p>Warning! Deleting cannot be undone!</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="modal-footer">
                        <a href="{{ url_for('delete_country', country_id=country.id) }}" class="btn red">Delete</a>
                        <a href="{{ url_for('countries') }}" class="modal-close btn green">Cancel</a>
                    </div>
                </div>

            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
    {% endfor %}
</div>
```

```python
class Country(db.Model):
    # schema for the Country model
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    country_name = db.Column(db.String(25), unique=True, nullable=False)
    country_image_url = db.Column(db.String(250), unique=True, nullable=True)
    leagues = db.relationship(
        "League", backref="country", cascade="all, delete", lazy=True)

    def __repr__(self):
        # __repr__ to represent itself in the form of a string
        return
        f"#{self.country_name} - Country Image URL: {self.country_image_url}"
```

```python
# Route for all countries
@app.route("/countries")
def countries():
    countries = list(Country.query.order_by(Country.country_name).all())
    return render_template("countries.html", countries=countries)
```

### Add Country Button (Admin Only)

The Add Country button only appears on the countries page if the user logged in is an admin. Clicking the button takes the admin user to the Add Country page which is discussed below.

![Add Country Button](documentation/testing/atletico-crud-add-country-button.png)

```html
{% if session.user|lower == "admin"|lower %}
<div class="row">
    <div class="col s12 center-align">
        <a href="{{ url_for('add_country') }}" class="btn-large cyan darken-4 white-text">
            Add Country +
        </a>
    </div>
</div>
{% endif %}
{% endblock %}
```

### Add Country Page (Admin Only)

The Add Country page allows the admin user to type in a country name to the form as well as an image url to represent that particular country. The code snippets below show the html form along with the python route. The python route for _Add Country_ below in conjunction with the country model above contain code which prevents duplicate entries such as adding the same country name twice.

```html
<div class="row">
    <form class="col s12" method="POST" action="{{ url_for('add_country') }}">
        <!-- Country Name -->
        <div class="row">
            <div class="input-field col s12">
                <input placeholder="Input Country Name" name="country_name" id="country_name" minlength="3"
                    maxlength="25" type="text" class="validate" required>
                <label for="country_name">Country Name</label>
            </div>
        </div>
        <!-- Country Image URL -->
        <div class="row">
            <div class="input-field col s12">
                <input placeholder="Input Country Image URL" name="country_image_url" id="country_image_url" minlength="3"
                    maxlength="250" type="text" class="validate" required>
                <label for="country_image_url">Country Image URL</label>
            </div>
        </div>
        <!-- Submit Button -->
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col s12 center-align">
                <button type="submit" class="btn-large cyan darken-4">
                    Add Country +
                </button>
            </div>
        </div>
    </form>
</div>
```

```python
# Route to add a country if admin
@app.route("/add_country", methods=["GET", "POST"])
def add_country():
    if session["user"] != "admin":
        return redirect(url_for("countries"))

    if request.method == "POST":

        existing_country = Country.query.filter(
            func.lower(Country.country_name) == request.form.get(
                "country_name").lower()).first()
        if existing_country:
            flash("Country Already Exists!")
            return redirect(url_for("add_country"))

        country = Country(
            country_name=request.form.get("country_name"),
            country_image_url=request.form.get("country_image_url")
            )

        db.session.add(country)
        db.session.commit()
        flash("Country Successfully Added!")
        return redirect(url_for("countries"))

    return render_template("add_country.html")
```

### Edit Country Button (Admin Only)

The Edit Country button only appears on the countries page if the user logged in is an admin. Clicking the button takes the admin user to the Edit Country page which is discussed below.

![Edit Country Button](documentation/testing/atletico-crud-edit-country-button.png)

```html
{% if session.user|lower == "admin"|lower %}
<a href="{{ url_for('edit_country', country_id=country.id) }}" class="btn-small green">Edit</a>
<a href="#modal-{{ country.id }}" class="btn-small red modal-trigger">Delete</a>
{% endif %}
```

### Edit Country Page (Admin Only)

The Edit Country page allows the admin user to edit the details for a country such as the country name and the image url to represent that particular country. The code snippets below show the html form along with the python route. The python route for _Edit Country_ below in conjunction with the country model above contain code which prevents duplicate entries such as editing an existing country to be the same as another country which already exists in the database.

```html
<div class="row">
    <form class="col s12" method="POST" action="{{ url_for('edit_country', country_id=country.id) }}">
        <!-- Country Name -->
        <div class="row">
            <div class="input-field col s12">
                <input placeholder="Input Country Name" name="country_name" value="{{ country.country_name}}"
                    id="country_name" minlength="3" maxlength="25" type="text" class="validate" required>
                <label for="country_name">Country Name</label>
            </div>
        </div>
        <!-- Country Image URL -->
        <div class="row">
            <div class="input-field col s12">
                <input placeholder="Input Country Image URL" name="country_image_url" value="{{ country.country_image_url}}"
                    id="country_image_url" minlength="3" maxlength="250" type="text" class="validate" required>
                <label for="country_image_url">Country Image URL</label>
            </div>
        </div>
        <!-- Submit Button -->
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col s12 center-align">
                <button type="submit" class="btn-large cyan darken-4">
                    Edit Country +
                </button>
            </div>
        </div>
    </form>
</div>
```

```python
# Route to edit country if admin
@app.route("/edit_country/<int:country_id>", methods=["GET", "POST"])
def edit_country(country_id):
    country = Country.query.get_or_404(country_id)

    if request.method == "POST":

        existing_country = Country.query.filter(
            func.lower(Country.country_name) == request.form.get(
                "country_name").lower()).first()
        if existing_country:
            flash("Country Already Exists!")
            return redirect(url_for("countries"))

        country.country_name = request.form.get("country_name")
        country.country_image_url = request.form.get("country_image_url")
        db.session.commit()
        flash("Country Successfully Updated!")
        return redirect(url_for("countries"))
    return render_template("edit_country.html", country=country)
```

### Delete Country Button (Admin Only)

The Delete Country button only appears on the countries page if the user logged in is an admin. Clicking the button initiates a modal which pops up asking the user if they definitely wish to proceed with the deletion which is discussed in the next section.

![Delete Country Button](documentation/testing/atletico-crud-delete-country-button.png)

```html
{% if session.user|lower == "admin"|lower %}
<a href="{{ url_for('edit_country', country_id=country.id) }}" class="btn-small green">Edit</a>
<a href="#modal-{{ country.id }}" class="btn-small red modal-trigger">Delete</a>
{% endif %}
```

### Delete Country Modal (Admin Only)

The modal pop-up allows a user to confirm the deletion by clicking Delete or to cancel the deletion by clicking Cancel. Clicking Cancel takes the user back to the countries page.

![Delete Modal](documentation/testing/atletico-crud-chrome-delete-modal.png)

```html
<!-- Modal to confirm delete -->
<div id="modal-{{ country.id }}" class="modal">
    <div class="modal-content">
        <h4>Are You Sure?</h4>
        <p>Warning! Deleting cannot be undone!</p>
    </div>
    <div class="modal-footer">
        <a href="{{ url_for('delete_country', country_id=country.id) }}" class="btn red">Delete</a>
        <a href="{{ url_for('countries') }}" class="modal-close btn green">Cancel</a>
    </div>
</div>
```

If the user proceeds with confirming the deletion, the python route for _Delete Country_ is shown below. Although the Country model is a Postgres model, the delete route below also contains code for the deletion of data from MongoDB. The reason for this is that whilst Country, League and Club are all stored in Postgres, the data for Players is stored in MongoDB. The Postgres models have been set up so that the deletion of a table _e.g. Country_ cascades to any tables linked to it as per the models.

For example, the country England, has a League (Premier League) which in turn has two Clubs (Newcastle and Liverpool). The Clubs Newcastle and Liverpool have two players respectively. If the Country England was deleted, the League (Premier League) and the Clubs (Newcastle and Liverpool) would also be deleted as per due to the relationship set-up between the Postgres tables in the models. As the MongoDB Players table is not linked to the Postgres tables via the Postgres models, the Players associated with any Leagues or Clubs within the Country of England would not be deleted without the inclusion of the MongoDB line of code in the Delete Country route highlighted below.

```python
# Route to delete country if admin
@app.route("/delete_country/<int:country_id>")
def delete_country(country_id):
    if session["user"] != "admin":
        return redirect(url_for("countries"))
    else:
        country = Country.query.get_or_404(country_id)
        mongo.db.players.delete_many({"country_id": (country_id)})
        db.session.delete(country)
        db.session.commit()
        flash("Country Successfully Deleted!")
        return redirect(url_for("countries"))
```

### Discussion On Page Features

The features discussed above for _Countries_ are applicable for the following:
- Leagues
- Add League
- Edit League
- Delete League
- Clubs
- Add Club
- Edit Club
- Delete Club
- Players
- Add Player
- Edit Player
- Delete Player

The only difference is in the _routes_ for _Leagues, Clubs_ and _Players_ with regards to filtered and unfiltered views. This is shown in the code and explained below.

```python
# Route to display all leagues if country_id == 0
# Otherwise route displays leagues for a specific country_id
@app.route("/leagues/<int:country_id>")
def leagues(country_id):
    if country_id == 0:
        leagues = list(League.query.order_by(League.league_name).all())
        return render_template("leagues.html", leagues=leagues)
    else:
        leagues = list(League.query.order_by(League.id).filter(
            League.country_id == country_id))
        return render_template("leagues.html", leagues=leagues)
```

The code above shows that if _Leagues_ is clicked via the _navbar_, the value of ```html <int:country_id>``` is equal to 0 and it will therefore return a view of ALL Leagues across ALL Countries. However, if the user clicks on England, the value of ```html <int:country_id>``` is equal to 1 and therefore the Leagues displayed are filtered for Leagues associated with that specific Country.

This logic also applies to the _Clubs_ and _Players routes_ e.g. if _Clubs_ is clicked via the _navbar_, the value of ```html <int:league_id>``` is equal to 0 and it will therefore return a view of ALL Clubs across ALL Leagues. However, if the user clicks on Premier League, the value of ```html <int:league_id>``` is equal to 1 and therefore the Clubs displayed are filtered for Clubs associated with that specific League.

### Players Page

The data for Players is stored in a MongoDB collection called _players_. Due to this, the code in the _Players route_ is different to _Countries, Leagues_ and _Clubs_ as shown below. A screenshot of the Mongo DB collection and an example of a document entry is also shown below.

![Mongo DB Players Collection](documentation/testing/atletico-crud-mongo-db-collection.png)

```python
# Route to display all players if league_id == 0
# Otherwise route displays players for a specific league_id
@app.route("/playersa/<club_id>")
def playersa(club_id):
    if club_id == "0":
        playersa = mongo.db.players.find()
        return render_template("playersa.html", playersa=playersa)
    else:
        playersa = mongo.db.players.find({"club_id": club_id})
        return render_template("playersa.html", playersa=playersa)
```

### Add Player Page (Admin Only)

The data for Players is stored in a MongoDB collection called _players_. Due to this, the code in the _Add Player route_ is different to _Add Country, Add League_ and _Add Club_ as shown below.

```python
# Route to add player if admin
@app.route("/add_playera", methods=["GET", "POST"])
def add_playera():
    if session["user"] != "admin":
        return redirect(url_for("playersa", club_id=0))
    else:
        if request.method == "POST":
            new_playera = request.form.get("player_image_url")
            if mongo.db.players.count_documents(
                    {"image_url": new_playera}, limit=1) == 0:
                club = Club.query.get_or_404(request.form.get("club_id"))
                league = club.league_id
                get_league = League.query.get_or_404(league)
                country = get_league.country_id
                playersa = {
                    "name": request.form.get("player_name"),
                    "dob": request.form.get("player_dob"),
                    "nationality": request.form.get(
                        "player_nationality"),
                    "position": request.form.get("player_position"),
                    "club_id": request.form.get("club_id"),
                    "league_id": league,
                    "country_id": country,
                    "image_url": request.form.get("player_image_url")
                }
                mongo.db.players.insert_one(playersa)
                flash("Player Successfully Added!")
                return redirect(url_for("playersa", club_id=club.id))
            else:
                flash("This Player Already Exists!")
                return redirect(url_for("add_playera"))

        clubs = list(Club.query.order_by(Club.club_name).all())
        return render_template("add_playera.html", clubs=clubs)
```

Additionally, it was not possible to prevent duplicate player entries by preventing the addition of a player with the same name. The reason for this is that there may be numerous players with the same name and there may be multiple entries of the same player if they were deemed to be legends for multiple clubs. For this reason, the *image_url* field was used as a unique identifier to prevent duplicate entries which can be seen in the code snippet above. This is discussed further in the _Features Left to Implement_ section.

### Edit Player Page (Admin Only)

The data for Players is stored in a MongoDB collection called _players_. Due to this, the code in the _Edit Player route_ is different to _Edit Country, Edit League_ and _Edit Club_ as shown below.

```python
# Route to edit player if admin
@app.route("/edit_playera/<player_id>", methods=["GET", "POST"])
def edit_playera(player_id):
    if session["user"] != "admin":
        return redirect(url_for("playersa", club_id=0))
    else:
        clubs = list(Club.query.order_by(Club.club_name).all())
        player = mongo.db.players.find_one({"_id": ObjectId(player_id)})
        if request.method == "POST":
            submit = {
                "name": request.form.get("player_name"),
                "dob": request.form.get("player_dob"),
                "nationality": request.form.get(
                    "player_nationality"),
                "position": request.form.get("player_position"),
                "club_id": request.form.get("club_id"),
                "image_url": request.form.get("player_image_url")
                }
            mongo.db.players.update_one(
                {"_id": ObjectId(player_id)}, {"$set": submit})
            flash("Player Successfully Updated!")
            return redirect(url_for("playersa", club_id=0))
        return render_template("edit_playera.html", player=player, clubs=clubs)
```

### Delete Player Modal (Admin Only)

The data for Players is stored in a MongoDB collection called _players_. Due to this, the code in the _Delete Player route_ is different to _Delete Country, Delete League_ and _Delete Club_ as shown below.

```python
# Route to delete player if admin
@app.route("/delete_playera/<player_id>")
def delete_playera(player_id):
    if session["user"] != "admin":
        return redirect(url_for("playersa", club_id=0))
    else:
        mongo.db.players.delete_one({"_id": ObjectId(player_id)})
        flash("Player Successfully Deleted!")
        return redirect(url_for("playersa", club_id=0))
```

### Form Page

The Form page is only visible in the _navbar_ if the user is not an admin as discussed in the _navbar_ section. The purpose of the form is for a non-admin user to submit a form to request that a player be added to the database. The form in the project is a dummy form and does not have a POST method as shown in the _route_ code below.

```python
# Route to form if user != admin
@app.route("/form")
def form():
    if session["user"] == "admin":
        return redirect(url_for("profile", username=session["user"]))
    else:
        return render_template("form.html")
```

The form's action directs the user to _confirmation.html_ as shown below.

```html
<h3 class="cyan-text text-darken-4 center-align">Player Submission Form</h3>

<div class="row">
    <form class="col s12" action="{{ url_for('confirmation') }}">
```

### Confirmation Page

The Confirmation page is only accessible if the user is not an admin as shown in the _route_ below.

```python
# Route to confirmation page after form submission
@app.route("/confirmation")
def confirmation():
    if session["user"] == "admin":
        return redirect(url_for("profile", username=session["user"]))
    else:
        return render_template("confirmation.html")
```

The user is directed to the confirmation page after submitting an entry via the form page.

### Footer

The footer is very simple and is generated via Materialize CSS. It simply contains the name of the database and the name of the developer. The name of the developer acts as a hyperlink to the developer's GitHub profile which opens in a new tab.

![Footer](documentation/testing/atletico-crud-footer.png)

### Favicon

The favicon is an icon of the blue star which used to be the sponsor on Newcastle United's kit in the 90s.

![Favicon](atleticocrud/static/images/atletico-crud-favicon.png)

## Features Left to Implement

### Improved Admin Functionality

A toggle for username's with admin rights instead of relying on a username.

### Search Functionality

The ability to search for a specific league, club or player.

### Improved Route Mapping

Route for clubs would be country/league/club instead of club/league_id.
Route for players would be country/league/club/player instead of player/club_id.

### Enter Full Record Functionality

A method for a full record to be added whereby a country, league, club and player could be added from one form with data being stored in the relevant tables.

### Further Prevention Of Duplicate Player Entires

I would like to create a method where multiple criteria are assessed to prevent duplicate player entries. For example, if the player name, club name and nationality were the same but the DOB was different, this would be allowed. However, if all fields were the same, this would not be allowed.
