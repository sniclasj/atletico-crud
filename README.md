# Atletico Crud

![Am I Responsive](documentation/testing/atletico-crud-am-i-responsive.png)

Atletico Crud is an online soccer/football database.

The database contains players who are renowned as having 'legend status' for a particular club, in a particular league within a particular country _e.g. Alan Shearer who played for Newcastle United in the Premier League in England._

The aim of the website is for users to view players who have already been inducted to the database and for them to submit their own suggestions for players to be entered into the database via a Form.

The website's admin will then review the submitted forms and decide whether to create a new entry. The admin has the ability to create/add, read/view, update/edit and delete data.

# UX
The aim of the site is to be as minimal as possible so that attention is focused on the database content.

Once registered or logged in, users are taken their profile page. From here, the ever present navigation bar allows the user to navigate to Countries, Leagues, Clubs or Players. When utilising the links in the navbar directly _e.g. clicking Clubs_, the user will be directed to a view showing all clubs across all leagues present in the database. However, if the player were to navigate to _Leagues_ first before selecting _Premier League_, the club's visible would be filitered so that only Premier League clubs are displayed. This gives the user the felxibility to look at what they are most interested in viewing.

Users can also navigate to a _Form_ page to submit their suggestions for players who they believe should be inducted into the database.

The website utilises Materialize CSS to responsively react to different screen sizes so that the user can view content on multiple devices.

## Colour Scheme
I selected the dark-cyan and white colour scheme as they contrasted nicely with each other _e.g. white text on a dark-cyan background or vice versa_. The dark-cyan also didn't clash with any country flag, league logo or club crest/kit and was a more interesting colour than a dark grey or black.

The colour scheme below was generated by [coolors](https://coolors.co/).

## Typography
The font used for the logo and the page headings is Monoton from Google Fonts. I chose this font as it reminded me of the font utilised by the football/soccer magazine 'Mundial'.
